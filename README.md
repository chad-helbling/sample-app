# Sample App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

This app uses the SpaceX crew api to display some crew data with a search function and an agency filter.

Additionally it uses [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/) to connect a crypto wallet

[Next-Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) is used to provide some simple credential authentication.
